## Day 5
Learn about the RecyclerView.
- RecyclerView allows us to scroll through views in list form
- RecyclerView goes hand in hand with an Adapter
- Adapter manages the list of views being scrolled by wrapping each view in an AdapterViewHolder
- AdapterViewHolder is a wrapper around a view in the list
- AdapterViewHolder controls the layout components inside the view, and handles things like clicks on the view

### Objective
Replace ScrollView and TextView with RecyclerView and ViewHolders for each forecast item. (47 TODO items)
