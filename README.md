## Day 1
Introduce technology stack:
  - Parse Server back end
  - Android front end

Install Android Studio. (Could take a lifetime on the connection here.)

## Day 2
Introduce Java. Begin Android development ([Lesson 1](https://github.com/mog96/code-for-palestine-2017_y3-gaza/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson01-ScrollView-Demo)).

### Exercise
Build a weather app that fetches data from an API, and displays it in a scrollable TextView ([Lesson 2](https://github.com/mog96/code-for-palestine-2017_y3-gaza/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson02-Weather-App-Using-ScrollView)).

## Day 3
Cover **Git** usage, before having students pull Day 3 exercise files.
- Clone
- Check out branch
- Commit
- Pull
Leave 'Push' for when we start projects.

### Exercise
Finish yesterday's exercise ([Lesson 2](https://github.com/mog96/code-for-palestine-2017_y3-gaza/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson02-Weather-App-Using-ScrollView)).

## Day 4
Learn about Intents and multiple activities in an Android app.

Learn about the RecyclerView ([Lesson 4](https://github.com/mog96/code-for-palestine-2017_y3-gaza/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson04-Weather-App-Using-RecyclerView), for demonstration only).
- RecyclerView allows us to scroll through views in list form
- RecyclerView goes hand in hand with an Adapter
- Adapter manages the list of views being scrolled by wrapping each view in an AdapterViewHolder
- AdapterViewHolder is a wrapper around a view in the list
- AdapterViewHolder controls the layout components inside the view, and handles things like clicks on the view

### Exercise
Add forecast detail activity to the weather app, shown when a user taps a forecast in the main activity ([Lesson 3](https://github.com/mog96/code-for-palestine-2017_y3-gaza/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson03-Weather-App-With-Detail-Activity)).

Add ability to share forecast text from detail activity.

Add ability to open map from main activity. (Future version of the weather app will support weather map...?)

## Day 5
Introduction to Android UI elements.

Introduction to Android layouts: [video](https://youtu.be/8agCiQzDZys?t=1m18s).

### Exercises
#### Morning Session (3.5 hrs)
Start a new project and try adding different UI elements to a layout. Experiment with tweaking UI of previous exercises.

Start a new project and add a new activity from scratch. Add the ability to take text entered in an EditText in the main Activity and pass it via an Intent to a child Activity to be displayed.

#### Afternoon Session (1.5 hrs)
Start boarding pass app, a.k.a. LayoutMania ([Lesson 5](https://github.com/mog96/code-for-palestine-2017_y3-gaza/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson05-Boarding-Pass-App-With-ConstraintLayout)).

## Day 6
Master the ConstraintLayout.

### Exercise
Finish layout of boarding pass app ([Lesson 5](https://github.com/mog96/code-for-palestine-2017_y3-gaza/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson05-Boarding-Pass-App-With-ConstraintLayout)).

## Day 7
Learn to use data binding to bring a layout to life.

### Exercises
Add data binding to the passport app to populate it with flight information ([Lesson 6](https://github.com/mog96/code-for-palestine-2017_y3-gaza/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson06-Boarding-Pass-App-With-Data-Binding)).
